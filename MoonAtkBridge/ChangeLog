	* patches/moonlight-ff3.6.diff: Add a patch for Moonlight to allow
	their XPI to install on latest Firefox.

2009-06-05  Brad Taylor  <brad@getcoded.net>

	* Makefile.am: 
	* configure.ac: Rewrite the toplevel Makefile to compile glib, atk and
	MoonAtkBridge in one shot.  This will allow us to sidestep the merger
	and still build one DLL for consumption.

	* patches/001_gtk-sharp_target-smcs.diff: Update gtk-sharp Makefiles to
	add a list-sources target (huge hack) so that we can get at the list of
	files to compile for atk and glib.

2009-06-03  Andrés G. Aragoneses  <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* configure.ac: the env var is now needed for moon as well.
	* Makefile.am: fix build wrt MonoMerge from trunk, merging
	config files as well, needed by the XPI.

	* patches/moonlight-a11y-slot-tree.diff: 
	* patches/moonlight-a11y-initialization.diff: Update the patches to
	reflect the most recent work to get the whole toolchain complete.

2009-06-02  Andrés G. Aragoneses  <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* patches/moonlight-a11y-slot-tree.diff: Added incomplete patch
	to hook into the new API introduced in BMO#480317.

	from gtk-sharp building, merging and XPI building.

	* Makefile.am: Fix build of monomerge to not require a
