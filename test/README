OVERVIEW
---------------

Directories:

  samples: This directory contains sample applications that will be tested
          against

  testers: This directory contains test scripts that are executed against the
          sample applications 

  harness:  This directory contains scripts that do one or both of the 
            following:

              1.  Copy test scripts to remote machines
              2.  Copy sample applications to remote machines
              3.  Excute the tests onremote machine
              4.  Copy the remote logs to a centralized location

  resources:  This directory contains custom stylesheets and images for
              beautifying log files.

Remember:
  
  Always update the uia2atk/test/ChangeLog file when adding, modifying, or
  removing any files in uia2atk/test.

EXECUTING TESTS
---------------

  SET ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE (RECOMMENDED)

  Set your UIAQA_HOME environment variable to this test directory, for example:

  export UIAQA_HOME=/home/a11y/<test directory>

  To set the environment variable permanently, you might add it to your .bashrc
  script, or a local boot script (like boot.local in SUSE or rc.local in
  RedHat).

  NOTE:  If you do not set the environment variable, you must explicitly 
  specify the full path of the sample application when executing the test
  script.

EXECUTE THE TEST SCRIPT

  Test scripts can be found in the 'testers' directory.  If you have set your 
  UIAQA_HOME environment variable, you may simply run the test script
  without any arguments (i.e., testers/checkbutton-basic-ops.py).

  If you did not set your UIAQA_HOME environment variable, you must specify the
  full path of the sample application when executing the test script.  For
  example:

  ./checkbutton-basic-ops.py /home/a11y/<test directory>/samples/checkButton.py

  When the test is executed, you should see the sample application appear on
  your desktop, Strongwind will execute some tests, and the application should
  close. 

BEAUTIFY THE LOG

  Strongwind generates very useful log files.  By default, the log is saved in
  /tmp/strongwind.  Custom stylesheets and images can (and should) be copied
  to the log directory to make the logs pretty.  The stylesheets and images are
  stored in the <test directory>/resources directory.  Simply copy everything
  in that directory to your log directory.  For example:

  cp /home/a11y/<test directory>/resources/* /tmp/strongwind

  Then browse to <log_direcory>/procedures.xml (/tmp/strongwind/procedures.xml)
  by default in your web browser.

  In practice, the stylesheets should be edited to point to the appropriate
  resources instead of copying the resources to the directory of every log.
  This is simply to save storage pace.
