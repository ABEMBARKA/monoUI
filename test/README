OVERVIEW

Directories:

  samples: This directory contains sample applications that will be tested
          against

  testers: This directory contains test scripts that are executed against the
          sample applications 

  harness:  This directory contains scripts that do one or both of the 
            following:

              1.  Copy test scripts to remote machines
              2.  Copy sample applications to remote machines
              3.  Excute the tests onremote machine
              4.  Copy the remote logs to a centralized location

  resources:  This directory contains custom stylesheets and images for
              beautifying log files.

Remember:
  
  Always update the uia2atk/test/ChangeLog file when adding, modifying, or
  removing any files in uia2atk/test.

EXECUTING TESTS
---------------

EXECUTE THE TEST SCRIPT

  You may simply run the test script without any arguments (i.e.,
  testers/checkbutton-basic-ops.py).  This should always work if you have
  not modified the test directory structure after obtaining the test code.

  You may also full path of the sample application when executing the test
  script.  For example:

  ./checkbutton-basic-ops.py /home/a11y/<test directory>/samples/checkButton.py

  When the test is executed, you should see the sample application appear on
  your desktop, Strongwind will execute some tests, and the application should
  close. 

BEAUTIFY THE LOG

  Strongwind generates very useful log files.  By default, the log is saved in
  /tmp/strongwind.  Custom stylesheets and images can (and should) be copied
  to the log directory to make the logs pretty.  The stylesheets and images are
  stored in the <test directory>/resources directory.  Simply copy everything
  in that directory to your log directory.  For example:

  cp /home/a11y/<test directory>/resources/* /tmp/strongwind

  Then browse to <log_direcory>/procedures.xml (/tmp/strongwind/procedures.xml)
  by default in your web browser.

  In practice, the stylesheets should be edited to point to the appropriate
  resources instead of copying the resources to the directory of every log.
  This is simply to save storage pace.
