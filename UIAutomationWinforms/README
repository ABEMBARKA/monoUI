UIAutomationWinforms is a project of the Mono Accessibility team. Its purpose
is to implement provider pattern interfaces defined in Microsoft's UI Automation
(UIA) specification for the standard controls provided by System.Windows.Forms.

1. Package contents
===================

Implementation of UIA providers for Mono's Winforms controls.  This package
provides the following assemblies:

	UIAutomationWinforms.dll: Contains infrastructure for getting info from
	                          Mono's Winforms controls, creating providers
	                          for the controls, and interfacing with the
	                          UIA core to get provider information to the
	                          native accessibility bridge (eg UiaAtkBridge).


2. Compilation and Installation
===============================

	a. Build Requirements
	---------------------

		To build UIAutomationWinforms, you will need the following components:

			* pkg-config
			* mono >= 2.2
			* mono-data >= 2.2
			* gtk-sharp2
			* glib-sharp2
			* mono-uia >= 0.9 (provided by UIAutomation package)
			* Tests require nunit >= 2.4.7

	b. Building the Software
	------------------------

		If you obtained this package as an officially released tarball,
		this is very simple, use configure and make:

			./configure --prefix=/usr/local
			make
			make install

	c. Building the Software from SVN
	---------------------------------

		If you obtained this package from Subversion, use autogen.sh:

			./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr/local
			make
			make install

		Please note that unreleased versions of this software may
		require an unreleased version of Mono. The Mono a11y team must
		sometimes patch Mono's Winforms controls to enhance UIA support.
		In that case, it is recommended to install this package, Mono,
		and other dependencies in a parallel environment.  Instructions
		are available on the wiki:
