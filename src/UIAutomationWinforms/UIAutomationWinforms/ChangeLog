	* Mono.UIAutomation.Winforms.mdp: Turn of reference synchronization for
	  now so that MonoDevelop doesn't try to add references to everything
	  in the Olive package just because we use WindowsBase.  This will
	  require us to manually update the Makefile.am files when modifying
	  project references.
	* Makefile.am: Use -lib to expand compiler's reference search scope so
	  we can be more specific about assembly reference instead of using
	  blanket package references.

	  Mono.UIAutomation.Winforms/ButtonProvider.cs: Beginnings of
	  IWindowProvider and IInvokeProvider implementations.
