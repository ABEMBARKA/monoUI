	* Mono.UIAutomation.Winforms/WindowProvider.cs,
	  Mono.UIAutomation.Winforms/FormListener.cs: HACK: Make
	  WindowProvider.controlProviders dictionary internal so that
	  FormListener can raise StructureChangedEvents for form controls
	  *after* the form has already been registered in ATK.  Also, support
	  NativeWindowHandleProperty in the WindowProvider (return the form's
	  Handle IntPtr).
	* Mono.UIAutomation.Winforms/ButtonProvider.cs: HostRawElementProvider
	  should the containing window, so use button.TopLevelControl.Handle,
	  not button.Handle, to get it.

2008-04-24  Sandy Armstrong <sanfordarmstrong@gmail.com> 

	* Mono.UIAutomation.Winforms/WindowProvider.cs: Don't raise events if
	  clients aren't listening.  Test implementation of
	  Minimizable/Maximizable.

2008-04-23  Sandy Armstrong <sanfordarmstrong@gmail.com> 

	* UIAutomationWinforms.mds: Add unit test project for
	  Mono.UIAutomation.Winforms.

2008-04-18  Sandy Armstrong <sanfordarmstrong@gmail.com> 

	* Mono.UIAutomation.Winforms/WindowProvider.cs: Handle form closed
	  event.

2008-04-06  Sandy Armstrong <sanfordarmstrong@gmail.com> 

	* Mono.UIAutomation.Winforms/Mono.UIAutomation.Winforms.mdp: Reference
	  UIA assemblies from local build instead of GAC to facilitate rapid
	  development.
	* Mono.UIAutomation.Winforms/FormListener.cs: Call
	  AutomationInteropProvider to send provider events.  No more direct
	  dependency on bridge.

2008-04-03  Sandy Armstrong <sanfordarmstrong@gmail.com> 

	* Mono.UIAutomation.Winforms/WindowProvider.cs: Much more complete
	  implementation of WindowProvider.  Creates providers for buttons
	  that are on the form before it is shown, but does not handle
	  dynamically adding/removing controls yet.

2008-04-03  Sandy Armstrong <sanfordarmstrong@gmail.com> 

	* Mono.UIAutomation.Winforms/FormListener.cs: Basic integration with
	  UiaAtkBridge.

2008-04-02  Sandy Armstrong <sanfordarmstrong@gmail.com> 

	* Mono.UIAutomation.Winforms/Mono.UIAutomation.Winforms.mdp: Fix
	  winforms provider reference to UiaAtkBridge project, and sign
	  UiaAtkBridge assembly.

2008-03-25  Sandy Armstrong <sanfordarmstrong@gmail.com> 

	* Mono.UIAutomation.Winforms/AssemblyInfo.cs: Updated
	  company/product/copyright attributes.
	* Mono.UIAutomation.Winforms/ButtonProvider.cs,
	  Mono.UIAutomation.Winforms/WindowProvider.cs: Filled out some
	  implementation bits from playing with UISpy.

2008-03-25  Sandy Armstrong <sanfordarmstrong@gmail.com> 

	* UIAutomationWinforms.mds, Mono.UIAutomation.Winforms/AssemblyInfo.cs,
	  Mono.UIAutomation.Winforms/Mono.UIAutomation.Winforms.mdp: New
	  assembly, UIAutomationWinforms.dll, which is the implementation of
	  the UIA provider interfaces for winforms.  Intended to be installed
	  in GAC.
	* Mono.UIAutomation.Winforms/WindowProvider.cs,
	  Mono.UIAutomation.Winforms/ButtonProvider.cs: Beginnings of
	  IWindowProvider and IInvokeProvider implementations.
	* Mono.UIAutomation.Winforms/FormListener.cs: Class that is initialized
	  by winforms to listen for new form creation, create providers, and
	  push information to the UIA core/bridge.
