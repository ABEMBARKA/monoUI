	for bug not filed yet.

2008-04-30  Andres G. Aragoneses <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* patches/bug365437comm2v3.diff: Fixed the case when the

2008-04-28  Andres G. Aragoneses <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* patches/bug365437comm2v3.diff: Use the EmissionHookNative

2008-04-25  Andres G. Aragoneses <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* patches/bug365437comm2v3.diff: Don't expose GetSignalId

	with the signal name).

2008-04-25  Andres G. Aragoneses <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* patches/bug365437comm2v3.diff: First test to try

2008-04-24  Andres G. Aragoneses <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* patches/bug365437comm2.diff: Fix int->uint, coding style,
	added a pinvoke instead of refactoring yet, dispose a return
	GValue, correct params usage, ...

2008-04-23  Andres G. Aragoneses <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* patches/bug365437comm2.diff: More polishing changes,

2008-04-22  Andres G. Aragoneses <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* patches/bug365437comm2.diff: Same typo as previous
	one, but in other place (I need a new brain). Delete
	unneeded cast.

2008-04-22  Andres G. Aragoneses <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* patches/bug365437comm2.diff: Glub, super typo!
	(the instance is the obj itself, not the child).

2008-04-22  Andres G. Aragoneses <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* patches/bug365437comm2.diff: remove vals var, as I didn't use
	it in the end. Add call to g_signal_lookup although it does not
	compile yet (I don't want anybody to test this until it's stable
	BTW). Add author.

2008-04-22  Andres G. Aragoneses <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* patches/bug365437comm2.diff: first try doing things right:
	Signal.cs new methods, GQuark magic, etc.

2008-04-22  Andres G. Aragoneses <aaragoneses@novell.com>

2008-04-21  Andres G. Aragoneses <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* patches/winforms-uia.patch: use #if NET_2_0, as Sys.Env.SetEnvVar is 2.0.

2008-04-18  Andres G. Aragoneses <aaragoneses@novell.com>

        * patches/bug365437comm2.diff: added emission of children-changed event 
        (later I'll move this to GLibSharp).

2008-04-17  Sandy Armstrong <sanfordarmstrong@gmail.com>

2008-04-17  Andres G. Aragoneses <aaragoneses@novell.com>

2008-04-17  Andres G. Aragoneses <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* patches/bug365437comm2.diff: add this temporary diff.
	It will evolve until being the correct GSignalEmissionHook
	binding and then be included in Atk#.

2008-04-11  Andres G. Aragoneses <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* patches/bug526752onBGO.diff: Add the third (and last)
	symbol deprecated.

2008-04-08  Mike Gorse <mgorse@novell.com>

2008-04-08  Andres G. Aragoneses <aaragoneses@novell.com>

2008-04-03  Sandy Armstrong <sanfordarmstrong@gmail.com>

	  Patch is made at the top level of the mcs project.

2008-04-03  Andres G. Aragoneses <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* patches/winforms-uia.patch: After gtk_init, recover last value
	of GTK_MODULES env var, just in case.

2008-04-03  Sandy Armstrong <sanfordarmstrong@gmail.com> 

	* patches/winforms-uia.patch: Instead of commenting out GTK+ code,
	  simply set GTK_MODULES env var to be empty first.  This also
	  prevents the GTK<->ATK bridge from loading and messing us up.

2008-04-03  Sandy Armstrong <sanfordarmstrong@gmail.com> 

	* patches/winforms-uia.patch: Added internal PreRun event so that UIA
	  knows when to start the glib mainloop.

2008-04-02  Sandy Armstrong <sanfordarmstrong@gmail.com> 

	* samples/tests.mds, Uia2Atk.mds: Clean up project/solution files.  F5
	  in MD should launch whatever project in ManagedTests is set as the
	  startup project/solution, defaulting to FormTest for purely selfish
	  reasons.

2008-04-01  Sandy Armstrong <sanfordarmstrong@gmail.com> 

	* patches/winforms-uia.patch: Commented out GTK+ init code.  Temporary
	fix to prevent conflicts with our ATK bridge.

2008-03-31  Andres G. Aragoneses <aaragoneses@novell.com> 

	* UiaAtkBridge.mds: rename to Uia2Atk.mds.

2008-03-31  Andres G. Aragoneses <aaragoneses@novell.com> 

	* UiaAtkBridge: Add first version of the bridge.
	* UiaAtkBridge.mds: Add a global solution.
