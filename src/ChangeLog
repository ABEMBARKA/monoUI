	* patches/winforms-uia.patch: After gtk_init, recover last value
	of GTK_MODULES env var, just in case.

2008-04-03  Sandy Armstrong <sanfordarmstrong@gmail.com> 

	* patches/winforms-uia.patch: Instead of commenting out GTK+ code,
	  simply set GTK_MODULES env var to be empty first.  This also
	  prevents the GTK<->ATK bridge from loading and messing us up.

2008-04-03  Sandy Armstrong <sanfordarmstrong@gmail.com> 

	* patches/winforms-uia.patch: Added internal PreRun event so that UIA
	  knows when to start the glib mainloop.

2008-04-02  Sandy Armstrong <sanfordarmstrong@gmail.com> 

	* samples/tests.mds, Uia2Atk.mds: Clean up project/solution files.  F5
	  in MD should launch whatever project in ManagedTests is set as the
	  startup project/solution, defaulting to FormTest for purely selfish
	  reasons.

2008-04-01  Sandy Armstrong <sanfordarmstrong@gmail.com> 

	* patches/winforms-uia.patch: Commented out GTK+ init code.  Temporary
	fix to prevent conflicts with our ATK bridge.

	* UiaAtkBridge.mds: Add a global solution.
