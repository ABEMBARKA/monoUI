        * patches/bug365437comm2.diff: added emission of children-changed event 
        (later I'll move this to GLibSharp).

2008-04-17  Sandy Armstrong <sanfordarmstrong@gmail.com> 

	* Uia2Atk.mds: Delete unused UIAutomationCore.

2008-04-17  Andres G. Aragoneses <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* patches/bug365437comm2.diff: forgot to initialize the GHashTable.

2008-04-17  Andres G. Aragoneses <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* patches/bug365437comm2.diff: add this temporary diff.
	It will evolve until being the correct GSignalEmissionHook
	binding and then be included in Atk#.

2008-04-11  Andres G. Aragoneses <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	symbol deprecated.

	* patches/bug526752onBGO.diff: Removed atkobject.c changes,
	removed ATK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED diff from atk/Makefile.am,
	moved atkobject.h conditionals to the exposed functions

2008-04-08  Andres G. Aragoneses <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* patches/bug526752onBGO.diff: Add this first version.

2008-04-03  Sandy Armstrong <sanfordarmstrong@gmail.com>

	  Patch is made at the top level of the mcs project.

2008-04-03  Andres G. Aragoneses <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* patches/winforms-uia.patch: After gtk_init, recover last value
	of GTK_MODULES env var, just in case.

2008-04-03  Sandy Armstrong <sanfordarmstrong@gmail.com> 

	* patches/winforms-uia.patch: Instead of commenting out GTK+ code,
	  simply set GTK_MODULES env var to be empty first.  This also
	  prevents the GTK<->ATK bridge from loading and messing us up.

2008-04-03  Sandy Armstrong <sanfordarmstrong@gmail.com> 

	* patches/winforms-uia.patch: Added internal PreRun event so that UIA
	  knows when to start the glib mainloop.

2008-04-02  Sandy Armstrong <sanfordarmstrong@gmail.com> 

	* samples/tests.mds, Uia2Atk.mds: Clean up project/solution files.  F5
	  in MD should launch whatever project in ManagedTests is set as the
	  startup project/solution, defaulting to FormTest for purely selfish
	  reasons.

2008-04-01  Sandy Armstrong <sanfordarmstrong@gmail.com> 

	* patches/winforms-uia.patch: Commented out GTK+ init code.  Temporary
	fix to prevent conflicts with our ATK bridge.

2008-03-31  Andres G. Aragoneses <aaragoneses@novell.com> 

	* UiaAtkBridge.mds: rename to Uia2Atk.mds.

2008-03-31  Andres G. Aragoneses <aaragoneses@novell.com> 

	* UiaAtkBridge: Add first version of the bridge.
	* UiaAtkBridge.mds: Add a global solution.
