	* FormTest.mdp: Clean up project/solution files.  F5 in MD should
	  launch whatever project in ManagedTests is set as the startup
	  project/solution, defaulting to FormTest for purely selfish
	  reasons.

	* FormTest.mdp: Little change, just add an additional form that is launched
	  at the same time as the first one. It's a simpler testcase for the Atk#
	  children because it doesn't involve events.
