	* FormTest.mdp: Add System.Drawing reference.
	* FormTest.cs: Add second button, disabled.

	* FormTest.mdp: Change AfterBuild command to copy libatk-bridge.so into
	  what will be our LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and Execute command to call new
	  formtest launcher script.
	* formtest: Execute script for FormTest that sets LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

	* FormTest.mdp: Automate copying of libatksharpglue-2.so from SVN and
	  the installed version of libatk-bridge.so.

	* FormTest.mdp: Clean up project/solution files.  F5 in MD should
	  launch whatever project in ManagedTests is set as the startup
	  project/solution, defaulting to FormTest for purely selfish
	  reasons.

	* FormTest.mdp: Little change, just add an additional form that is launched
	  at the same time as the first one. It's a simpler testcase for the Atk#
	  children because it doesn't involve events.
