UiaAtkBridge is a project of the Mono Accessibility team. Its purpose
is to translate between providers implementing interfaces from Microsoft's
UI Automation (UIA) specification, and the native accessibility infrastructure
on the Linux desktop (ATK+).

The bridge contains adapter Atk.Objects that wrap UIA providers.  Adapter
behavior is determined by provider ControlType and supported pattern interfaces.
The bridge implements interfaces from UIAutomationBridge which allow the UI
Automation core to send it automation events and provider information.

More information about the Mono Accessibility team and UIA on Linux can be found
on our wiki:

1. Package contents
===================

Bridge between UIA providers and ATK+.  This package provides the following
libraries:

	UiaAtkBridge.dll: Contains IAutomationBridge implementation and adapters
	                  that wrap UIA providers in Atk.Objects.
	libbridge-glue.so: Glue code that doesn't make sense to write managed,
                           and that does not fit in bindings like gtk-sharp.


2. Compilation and Installation
===============================

	a. Build Requirements
	---------------------

		To build UiaAtkBridge, you will need the following components:

			* pkg-config
			* mono >= 2.0
			* gtk-sharp2 >= 2.12.6
			* glib-sharp2 >= 2.12.6
			* libgobject
			* libgmodule
			* libglib
			* atk
			* mono-uia >= 0.9 (provided by UIAutomation package)
			* Tests require nunit >= 2.4.7

	b. Building the Software
	------------------------

		If you obtained this package as an officially released tarball,
		this is very simple, use configure and make:

			./configure --prefix=/usr/local
			make
			make install

	c. Building the Software from SVN
	---------------------------------

		If you obtained this package from Subversion, use autogen.sh:

			./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr/local
			make
			make install

		Please note that unreleased versions of this software may
		require an unreleased version of gtk-sharp. The Mono a11y team
		must sometimes patch gtk/glib/atk-sharp to enhance UIA support.
		In that case, it is recommended to install this package, Mono,
		and other dependencies in a parallel environment.  Instructions
		are available on the wiki:
